## Step-1 : You are given a list of 56 adjectives , select five or six you feel best describe your personality.
## Step-2 : Ask your Colleagues, peers, family members or friends to do the same for you.
<br>
These answers are then mapped onto a grid of four different boxes:
<br>
### Arena: Adjectives selected by both participant and others, representing personality traits that are known to both groups
### Façade: Adjectives selected only by the participant, representing personality traits that outsiders are not aware of
### Blind spot: Adjectives chosen by others that the subject doesn’t select, representing personality traits the subject is not aware of
### Unknown: Adjectives that were selected by neither party, either representing personality traits that don’t apply to the participant or hidden traits that neither group are aware of.
